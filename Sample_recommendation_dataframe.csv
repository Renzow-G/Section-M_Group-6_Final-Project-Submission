Midsommar,2019,3.78,"['Mystery', 'Drama', 'Horror']","Sure, it has just as much to say about our ignorance toward other cultural rituals (using Swedish folklore), but as a horror film about a failing relationship, Midsommar kind of broke me.

Captain America: Civil War,2016,3.58,"['Action', 'Science Fiction', 'Adventure']","The airport battle is still one of the best scenes in all of these movies, and the introduction to Holland’s Spider-Man is still such a joy and the best use of his iteration of the character in this series.

BlacKkKlansman,2018,3.94,"['Drama', 'Comedy', 'Crime']","It becomes painfully and chillingly obvious how relevant so much of the film’s commentary is, as Lee parallels “old America” to its current state of affairs through appropriate storytelling.
